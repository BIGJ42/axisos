## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Download the Latest Release

You can find the latest stable `.ISO` file on our [**Releases Page**](https://github.com/bigj42/axisos/releases).

### 2. Create a Bootable USB

Once you have downloaded the `.ISO` file, you will need to flash it to a USB drive (at least 8 GB is recommended). You can use tools like:
- [BalenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) (Windows)
- `dd` command (Linux)

**Example using `dd` on Linux:**
```bash
Be careful! Ensure /dev/sdX is your USB drive.
sudo dd if=AxisOS-v1.0.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress
```
### 3\. Install AxisOS
Reboot your computer and boot from the USB drive. The live environment will start, allowing you to "try before you install." From there, you can launch the installer to begin the installation process on your hard drive.
